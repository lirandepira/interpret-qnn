**Explicability and Inexplicability in the Interpretation of Quantum Neural Networks**

*LirandÃ« Pira & Chris Ferrie*

This code designs and implements a local model-agnostic interpreter for a quantum neural network. Consequently, in this simulation we define the so-called *band of inexplicability* which is evident when interpreting different data samples with a quantum classifier. This implies that there is a region in the classifier, in which corresponding data points will not have an interpretation, due to the random nature of quantum effects.

This tutorial style simulation has four main parts. After data loading, readers familiar with the concept of model-agnostic local interpretability, can skim through. The results in Classical Training section do not affect the simulations in Quantum Training section, and consequently the Band of Inexplicability.
